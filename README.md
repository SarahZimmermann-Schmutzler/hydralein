# HYDRALEIN

A programm to crack SSH passwords.  
This is a lightweight version of the known <a href="https://www.thc.org/">**Hydra**</a> - tool.  

The program was created as part of my training at the Developer Academy and is used exclusively for teaching purposes.  
It was coded on **Windows 10** using **VSCode** as code editor.
